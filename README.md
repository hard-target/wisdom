# Do we  “really”  know about ourselves? May not!!

Most of us  ignore  the things, that are available  ‘free’  to us!

We don’t attach much importance to them and take them “light” (most of the times)!

We all  have heard:  ‘Familiarity breeds contempt’.

How many of us feel comfortable to ‘receive’  (genuine) feedback (about  ourselves) from our own  family members?  

At work, we all are always ready to give (passionate) ‘lectures’  about the importance of  Collaboration, Communication,  Empathy, Positive Attitude,  Listening,  Service attitude, Helpful nature, Sensitivities etc., 

Do we ‘genuinely’  know how good we ourselves are, on such aspects?  

Our  ‘bosses’ (at work) won’t always share with us (all) our Improvement Areas, in detail.  Even when shared, much of it  is sugar-coated!   We usually end such discussions (most of the time) thinking that we are broadly  ‘fine’ / ‘OK’.  In reality, such discussions may not reflect our true  ‘X-ray’.  

By creating a pleasant environment at ‘home’, such aspects can be openly discussed, in a mutually beneficial manner for all members of the family. Parents, Spouse and also our children (where applicable) know (for sure) what we  ‘really’  are!

Once we are determined (with a positive mindset) to improve ourselves, MAGIC would flow into our lives (at  NO cost)! 😀

In the (very) first such meeting, we should be prepared to hear (even)  ‘shocking’ statements from our beloved family members on different components of our attitude.  

To make this process effective, one should be disciplined  NOT  to challenge / question (openly) the  ‘negative’  feedback received  from any member (then and there).   (Else, the real purpose won’t be served!)

It is advisable to begin such sessions with  ‘positive’ aspects of  behaviour / attitude.  (Leading to goose bumps / positive strokes for all participants! 😀😃).

Instead of each person narrating a long list in one-go, we can follow a round-robin mode (“all are equal” mindset), where each one mentions only one point, at a time, about each member in the group.   

(We can even try to alternate between positives and negatives).

I recommend  a total of  5  Positives and  3  Improvement areas to be carefully mentioned (one point at a time, in each round)  by each person about each family member  in the group (when their turn comes).  This involves going round the table multiple times (, to make it interesting and enjoyable).   It is natural to expect similar points (feedback) mentioned by different people for each person.   (It is up to the individual to take notes).

Obviously, a lot of (prior) planning (by each person) becomes essential to reduce the list to Top  few; and also to prioritise  them, if felt appropriate.  

This entire process shouldn’t be rushed thru.  (Demonstration of  abundant patience is highly recommended).

It should be planned in a very peaceful environment, when ALL the members are in pleasant moods.  
(NO mobiles /  NO  Television  please!).

Success of such discussions can be (easily) felt by the ‘reflective’ faces of the members (both during and immediately after such meetings).

This whole exercise should not lead to  a ‘blame’ game!  

Ultimate aim of this exercise is to   ‘help build stronger bonds’ amongst the family members.   Especially for the working members in the family, this should serve as a (major) reminder (especially)  for their (real)  Improvement Areas.

Why should we project multiple faces (one at office and another at home)?!

We frequently hear comments at home that:

“I am not like ‘this’ at office”, 

“I never talk this rough with my colleagues / outsiders“  etc.,

What wrong did our family members do to deserve our ire like this (once too often)?
(Are they being taken for granted?)

I’m  sorry for this  ‘looooong’ note, my dear friends!

If executed  perfectly, this exercise, I am sure, would progressively result in a  Heavenly Home  +  a  Happy / Rewarding  Office,  at the same time.  😀😀

(Please do not blame me, if this leads to ruckus and divorces!! 
😒😂)

PS:  
One should have the wherewithal to absorb the feedback, with a lot of grace and humility.

If not, one can’t be labelled as a Great Leader / person!



# Where are the  “parents”?  What are they doing  ‘now’?

Irrespective of the stature and status of our parents, all of us looked at them with awe (at least when we were young children). 

Each child looks up to  her / his parents with a ‘hero’ worship. 

By default, children imagine themselves as  (and aspire to become) future Teachers, Doctors, Lawyers, Bank Officers, (Software) Engineers, Farmers, Business Heads, Scientists, Cricketers, Writers, Singers, Soldiers etc., based on their parents’  profession.

Right from their Pre-KG days, children consider everything that their parents do  as most ideal / auspicious.

Children don’t mind fighting with their friends / cousins to prove a point that  ‘their’ parents are The  Best (and that their parents are always ‘right’).

Given this background, are we (as parents, where applicable) setting the ‘right’ examples for our beloved children, each moment of their waking hours? 

Right from their childhood, (almost all) children begin mimicking their parents’ mannerisms and words. 

In itself, ‘Conduct’ of the parents is an effective education for children (in real-time).

Gestures / mannerisms (good and bad), once gotten used to at an early age, are quite difficult to  get changed later (in life).

Children (usually) are gifted with great  ‘memory’.  
The poems and tables that we all memorised when we were very young can easily be recited many years later with minimum effort (exactly in the same tenor and tone)!  
Had we learnt even one syllable wrong in our childhood, the same mistake gets repeated, by default. 
(We all can relate to it, right? 🤔)

Children might forget what their parents  ‘told”  them  but they rarely forget what they  saw their parents  “doing”.

How careful should we then behave at home,  before our ‘captive audience’?

It is never too late (in life) to correct our ‘known’ mistakes! (That too, when we are convinced about the  ‘influence’ these would have on our children).

All this may sound  ‘common sensical’;  but, unfortunately, many of us aren’t able to do enough justice to our roles as parents (in these busy-busy crazy days)!

Those who have passed this stage (as young parents) may now be motivated to influence their next generation (, if they are allowed to)!

In today’s  DISK world of nuclear families, a child may be wondering where the parents are  ‘hiding’!
(DISK:  Double Income Single Kid)

Fortunately, we do have a  few Role Model  ‘young parents’ around us.    That breed should grow in size and character to enable a sociable and well cultured  future generation.

There is hope  BUT  a lot of  dedicated hard work is to be done passionately by parents,  with a sense of urgency.  

Often (these days), young couples are caught in a big dilemma between lucrative 24 x 7  Profession and self-nurturing  a  happy / healthy family.   This debate on the “Balancing” Act would go on endlessly.   
(Late marriages and forced (foreign) short  travels (official) are adding to further confusion).

Time  doesn’t  ‘pause’!   
Children grow everyday.

‘Responsible’  Parenting  leads to  Happier and Productive  Societies / Future! 😃😇

# When did you last ‘play’ with your family?    🏓🏸🤺

Some of you may have already experienced the ‘ecstasy’ of  playing with your beloved family members, at regular intervals.

I have been personally experiencing immeasurable happiness and thorough satisfaction consistently over the past four decades, thanks to my ‘addiction’ for ‘games’ with my family members (once a week).

A number of so-called Management principles (like Planning, Budgeting (of time), Strategy (to win), Competition Analysis, Strength-based Leadership, Execution perfection, Crisis Management  etc.,) along with many behavioural and attitudinal aspects (like learning from (ours as well as others) mistakes, facing adversity gracefully, sportively accepting failures, empathy (competitors as humans), collaboration / understanding (with partners), effective communication, will-to-win etc.,) can easily be learnt (in an interesting manner) while playing a variety of  games with our family members, every now and then.

A lot of fun coupled with strong bonding for life is guaranteed (at NO cost) MAGICally.

You may consider simple games like  Carroms, Chess, Scrabble, Table Tennis, Catan, Shuttle, Tennikoit, interesting card / Board games (like Monopoly), Boggle, memory games etc.,  
(NEVER encourage gambling)

Some of these can involve family members of different generations (right from 3 year kids  all the way to 80+ grandparents) comfortably.

Spending time on games (with family members) is (surely) ten times better than watching Television  or  dining out!  🌈⛳ 

For the (new) daughter-in-law of the house, I can’t think of a better induction than thru ‘fun and games’!  🤼‍♀🌹

“A  family that  PLAYs together  STAYs  together”!   ..   
I  can’t agree with this more, my dear  friends!  🏆🎗⛸

Why wait?     
Keep your ‘game’ plan ready for this Sunday (Today)  😀🤫

Wait  wait  wait . .. ... 
(A few tips)

1.   Some games involve ‘partners’ /  ‘teams’;   
Try different combinations by drawing  ‘lots’;  this would drastically improve our understanding and relationships at home with various  people! 👌😀
(ALL are ‘friends’).

2.  Don’t forget to heartily ‘compliment’  and  genuinely ‘appreciate’ the  ‘winners’ of each game (even if it is your spouse!) openly.
It can be in the form of ‘applause with smiles’,  ‘(very) well played’ / ‘well done dear’ kind of comments, ‘pat on the back’  etc.,

And, always  provide encouragement to the losers (might be our own team) with genuine comments (looking into their eyes) like  ‘well tried’, “better luck next game”, ‘it was (quite) close’  ..  all with a firm ‘shake hand’!

Your eternal Well Wisher
ASM

PS:  

Please ensure that we never ‘grudge’ anyone, after losing.
(All in the family).

All this is to enhance our relationships at home, all the time .. for the better!

Many times, members happily discuss at the dining table about their winning / (cunning😀) strategies adopted ..  and laugh heartily!
(Keep a water bottle handy😂)




# Thanks to “Traffic snarls”,  LQ levels can go up!  🤔
🚘🏍🚙🚲🚑🚛👩🏻‍🎓

We would be  ‘lying’  if we say we were never caught up in traffic.   

All of us (across the globe), these days, have been experiencing increased levels of ‘stress and frustration’ due to this traffic menace.  

Till a few years back, this used to be the case during the ‘peak’ hours that too on the week days.  
Can anyone predict the peak hours, these days?!
(My feel is 24 x 7 x 365 😂).

Thanks to millions of (Uber / Ola) cabs on the road today; coupled with the affordability of own vehicles being felt by the Middle Class, cities across the world are witnessing thousands of new vehicles entering the roads, everyday. It is very surprising and disappointing that any number of fly overs and introduction of Metros aren’t able to provide any solace to the vehicle drivers!!

Given this reality, how can the drivers (I mean ‘we ourselves’)  ‘protect’ themselves from the associated stress and view  this (idle / waiting time) as a hugely pleasant, peaceful and productive  ‘opportunity’ everyday?

1.  ALL of us should make it a daily  (healthy) habit to wake up quite early (at least on weekdays).

2.  Factoring in for the traffic slowdowns (and also for  ‘flat’ tyres), one should (proactively) plan to leave home about 20 minutes ahead of usual time, everyday.  (The exact minutes ahead depend on the total ‘normal’  commute time)

3.  (Thoroughly)  Prepare your ‘mind’  to remain ‘calm’, as and when traffic slows you down.  

4.  There is  nothing that  anyone  can do about the traffic jam.  
No point in ‘honking’ to show the restlessness.  
Any number of looks at the watch (in 10-second intervals) is not going to change the situation.

5.  Firstly,  we should  firmly ACCEPT  the situation.  
(We should thank ourselves  for starting ‘x’ minutes ahead of time!).  

6. We should  then immediately inform (with an ‘apologetic’ tone) the relevant person about this possible  delay, if this delay is going to make someone wait.  (This is minimum courtesy).
This should be done irrespective of the ‘stature’ of the person who would need to wait (customer, boss, guest or a team member).

This  call needs to be made not at the very last moment but the moment you sense the delay.  (Others can plan their time).

(I always believe in reaching the meeting point a couple of minutes ahead instead of “one second” late, even for my personal meetings).

All this would reduce some (not all) of our  embarrassment when we finally  make it  (late). 

Subsequent (most) IMPORTANT step:

7.  Now,  if  you really want to feel  ‘bad and sad’,  go ahead (and ‘worry’)  for a few SECONDS (only).   

(Worry doesn’t solve any problem.  It would only complicate the parameters on Diabetes and Blood Pressure, for sure).

8.  We  are now  ready for  our  LQ  improvement.
(With a much better mindset).

LQ:  Learning Quotient 🤔

The below steps are  NOT applicable for the 2-wheeler drivers.

9.  Our mind, at this juncture, (hopefully pacified) is ready to relax / absorb useful information.   

There are a number of things one can happily attempt.   

Listen to:

A.  One’s favourite music 
B.  Inspiring  audio books
C.  Inspirational ‘Pravachanams’ (talks) of  eminent leaders / philosophers

If we are travelling in a chauffeur-driven car, we may also consider to:

A.  Close our eyes and relax / power nap
B.   Refine our  ‘To Do’ list for the day (‘prioritise’)
C.   Involve in some ‘Positive’ Thinking (on any of our  Important and NOT Urgent aspects)

Even though this note looks longish, ‘essence’ can easily be internalised, Right?

Feel the light in adversity!

Your eternal well wisher 
ASM

PS:  

I got immensely benefited during the last two decades, implementing the above approaches.  

Thankfully, my BP and Sugar levels are under control (without medication)!

I could successfully complete listening to a few hundreds of audio books / talks, thanks to the Traffic snarls!  😇😊


# “Worry”,  The (evergreen) Menace!!

Did you ever get ‘inspired’ by someone who worries about something or other, all the time?  

How come we (love to) continue with this  ‘disease’  even after listening to hundreds of lectures and reading scores of articles written by people we admire, respect and love?

What is so attractive about ‘worrying’?
Why are we ‘wasting’ our precious time on this (day and night)?

Is there one benefit that we can think of (for ourselves, for our family or for our team / customer)?    
(At the minimum, ‘worry’  leaves  lines / wrinkles  on the forehead 😣).

Do a quick calculation (for yourself) on the time that you might have already spent (LOST) in your life  ‘just worrying’.

Is it not paradoxical that each of us can comfortably and readily ‘lecture’  on (the ‘ills’ of) this topic  (to any audience at anytime)🤔;
and, soon after such  ‘lecturing’, we are eager to go back to our own  “comfort zone” of worrying?!

(Crystal clear) Understanding of any issue puts us on an excellent platform where solutions can be found in an amazingly  interesting manner.

Many times, in my case, it helped me tremendously when I (dispassionately) disassociated myself from my  problem and wore my ‘consultant’  / ‘advisory’  hat.  
The solutions followed were MAGICal  and the delight levels were extraordinary.  😊

The most useful and critically important word I  found in my English Dictionary (fifty years ago) was:    EMPATHY.

This one word changed my life (and is still helping me) for the better, each day.

In the last two decades, I am able to relate to this word much deeper, after getting  convinced that  EMPATHY is indeed the essence of Spirituality and this trait alone can do wonders to our desire to  be ‘never angry’  and ‘always happy’!   😇😄

Subsequently, I was mesmerised when I added another word  COMPASSION to my limited vocabulary.  
I started observing that ‘Anger’, ‘Disappointment’ and ‘Worry’ started taking the backseat (to a point where dictionary is needed to know their complete meanings)!

Empathy and  Compassion, The Twins, won’t feel comfortable in the company of  Anger and Worry.  Nurturing our twins would drive away the ‘enemies’  automatically and effortlessly.

I conclude this by sharing the wonderful formula proposed by monk Gaur Gopal Das ji, to remain  Worry-free  for a lifetime.    Here it goes:

👉  Is there any problem in your life now?

     NO:    Then, why ‘worry’?             

     YES  (I have a problem):
     
     👉Is there something that ‘you’  can do about it?

          NO:  Then, why  ‘worry’?

          YES (I can do):  
             Then  DO  it.  
              Why  ‘worry’?

I was ecstatic while going thru the above  IF-THEN-ELSE (logic);   went thru it  multiple times and got fully convinced that I should  NEVER  ever  ‘worry’  (again) — irrespective of the Circumstances / Situations, People and Things around my life.  

Started living peacefully ever after. ..  ...  😊😇😃🤣

Want to try this?  
(No fee would be charged even after you become totally worry-free!)

Your eternal well wisher 
ASM
PS:
1.  Would love to hear your feedback (after about a month)

2.  You can claim  Success  only when your family and close friends begin wondering what  MAGIC struck you (seeing you  ‘Worry-free’  all the time).  
That goal should serve you to get  motivated  (to try), dear sisters and brothers!

3.  Always remember  that when we worry,  it is not just we ourselves who are looking / feeling  sad  BUT  the entire family becomes dull, seeing us worried.

Is  our ‘worry’ really  justified / worthy enough, then?

Kindly don’t  procrastinate  to reflect and to decide on ‘your’ strategy to address this ‘worry’  menace.   🙏🏻🙏🏻

(Feel free to read this all over again .  ..  ... This menace is not just yours / mine;  the entire humanity (including ‘monks’)  is plagued!)


# NOT  ‘escalating’  (in time) may cost you  your  ‘job’!

Very scary to imagine this, right?      

Escalations  are  ALWAYS ‘uncomfortable’ and ‘unpleasant’. No two opinions!

We think twice (actually, many times over) before escalating  ‘any’  matters to anyone (both at office as well as at home).

Many  ‘What-if’  scenarios flash our mind instantly.

Whenever we are in two minds (whether to escalate), the most important question we need to pose to ourselves, (to arrive at our plan of action confidently):

👉 What happens, if I keep ‘mum’  now?

What would be the consequences for me?  
For my Project?
For my company (/ family)?

(This is relevant for ALL the support services as well;  they deal with ‘internal’  ‘customers’).

The moment we (quickly) ‘document’ (for ourselves) the answers for above, clarity emerges.  

We would become bolder!  We shall sound  and  act  confident (because we then get convinced to initiate the ‘right’  thing  soonest)!  

Then, our mind would be clearer and any scope for a ‘guilt’ feeling  disappears.

Having decided to escalate, the next (process) steps are also equally important:

1. ‘Whom’ (all) to escalate (in the chain of hierarchy)?

2. ‘When’ (exactly) to escalate?
(Right away / in the evening / next morning / after ‘x’ days) 

3. ‘How’ to escalate?
(Physical meeting / phone call / SMS - WhatsApp / email) .. sensitivities!

4. ‘What’ (exactly) is to be escalated?  
(Preciseness, 
Facts and Figures, 
Tone and Tenor, Consequences for the project / company / family)

People often  ‘fear’  that escalation means “digging one’s  own grave”!   NOT True!
(Actually, it is  ‘saving’  yourself, your boss, your company / family from much bigger embarrassment, in the near future).

It is also not correct to assume that only junior level associates have this confusion / anxiety. 
I have seen Project Managers, Vice Presidents (and even CXOs) failing on this aspect and accumulating ‘scars’ (on their otherwise brighter profiles)!

I would (strongly) recommend that organisation’s  ‘culture’ on dealing with escalations (and the (specific) expectations from the associates) be included as a part of   ‘induction’  programs (even for the ‘experienced’  new associates).

Many fail to recognise that genuine escalation (in time) (even to one’s immediate ‘boss’) often results in their project getting the needed resources (‘oxygen’) on time. 

After all, in case our project ‘fails’, our boss needs to face (the ire of) his / her boss first!  This chain (rapidly) continues upwards all the way to CEO ‘facing’  The  Customer!!

Let’s also (clearly) remember that we should first make “all out” efforts ourselves, before escalating upwards.  ‘Frequent’  ‘unnecessary’ escalations from the same person may cost him / her the job!  (At the minimum, the ‘appraisal’ would be hopeless 😩).

One should be at their ‘collaborative’-best  with ALL stakeholders at all times, to live peacefully.  
This doesn’t mean we should never escalate on our partners.

Simple candid feedback from the customers, when not taken seriously (multiple times), may lead to severe escalations from the customer abruptly.  None can come to our rescue then!!

Escalation is always a “double-edged sword”!  

Handling escalations is an “art” which can be ‘learnt’, thankfully!  🤔

Which of the following two is (relatively) easier to digest?

1.  “Avoiding” unpleasantness today (by not informing our boss(es) about the mess being created in our project)

2.  Customer calling our higher ups (or even CEO) (directly without even keeping us in the loop) cancelling the project (or even relationship) tomorrow 

The answer is obvious!

Experience teaches us wisely. (Need not always be our own experience!).  
Leaders must encourage the proliferation of  the ‘wisdom’ gained (from both successful and disastrous ways of  dealing, with examples).

Now, please take a glance at the title of this message.

Wishing you all wholeheartedly that you do your job exceptionally well so that you don’t need to deal with this subject.   Please remember that (as a Leader) you can’t shirk away from the 
Mistakes (or errors in judgement) exercised by your own beloved Team Members.

Revisit your plans minutely. TODAY itself to Live in (better) peace.

Your eternal well wisher 
ASM

PS:  

1.  I am yet to come across any leader who didn’t have to deal with this subject (remember, I have retired!)

2.  The anger of our bosses would drastically reduce within a few minutes of hearing the escalation from us, since the action moves to ‘resolving’ the issue on hand.(everyone would then be a part of the solution).

# Let’s  live  a  Heavenly “Open Book”  life!   😇😄

Why do we need to   ‘hide’ anything  from  our  Family, (close)  Friends and  Team members?

What is the necessity to clutter  our minds with   ‘hidden’  agendas, every now and then? 

YET..  all of us desire to be always  ‘peaceful’!

Barring a few  exceptions like:

1. Life-threatening situations (God forbid), 

2. Aspects like customer-confidential matters, Yet-to-be-published company results, appraisal ratings  .. ...

and 

3. sensitive matters like disclosure of age  and salary / bonus earned (😄),  family health issues,  details of the WILL  .. ...

  what is the real need to maintain a   ‘clumsy’  mind, holding on to hundreds of so called  ‘confidential’  things??

(One may add  “a few” more ‘personal’-only matters to the above list. .. no issues).

Some of us are making our lives  complicated  (at times miserable too) and  are wasting  precious  ‘time and effort’  in trying to  carefully  ‘remember’  various insignificant  and unnecessary  (‘diplomatic’)  ‘lies’  we may have  spoken.  
(Sticking to ‘truth’ saves us a lot of processing time and memory space in our minds;  it saves us from embarrassment too!)

(Once we decide to sleep,) the number of  ‘seconds’  we take to forget  about our bed (and blanket) to ease ourselves  into our ‘dreams’, on a normal night  is a  good indicator  / reflection of our  peace of mind.
(Exceptions perhaps ..  the evenings when ‘our’ teams won a match; and the days when we had a ‘misunderstanding’ with any of our close-hearts).

The irony is that we  ALL expect  ALL the relevant news  to flow to us seamlessly, timely and truthfully (from our ‘bosses’ and  family members); and, we ourselves ‘hold on’ to (even vital) information  (‘tax’ing our minds) still expecting others around us to ‘behave’!

Agreed that  “Information is Power” in today’s  competitive world but you know that I am not referring to such things here (😃😩).  

In essence, I am of the firm and clear view that ‘more we share’  better are the prospects  for ‘our’ peace of mind.

(I am not recommending you  to ‘flood’ others‘ minds / brains with trivial / useless data (like which political parties you love and why!).

No  ‘recommendations’  are necessary for this August audience, to address this aspect.

The simple formula, I follow:

Share such information (proactively) with others what you yourself would normally expect from others.

This is equally applicable at office and at home.

Negative ‘surprises’ harm the relationships (at times irrevocably)!  

Let’s not take any (important) relationship for granted!

People today are not uncomfortable to exercise their ‘options’ both at office and at home!  (Even with a small misunderstanding!)

Why take chances?

Especially for a couple to be happily married for ‘centuries’
together, it is mandatory to maintain their minds with a spotless  ‘glassy’  transparency.   
This creates priceless MAGIC in their lives!

Your eternal well wisher 
ASM
PS:  

1. We all have experienced (the axiom) that whenever we were  ‘open’,  there was an order of magnitude improvement in our ‘Joys’ and a health deterioration in our ‘sorrows’.

2. Please share with me, if you have decided to ‘reflect’ on this (malady).  
I would be delighted even if 10% of the readers decide to be  10%  more ‘open’ from today, to help yourselves.

# “Listen” please!! Please!
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

We should never get tired in improving our  ‘listening’  skills.    Life-long!

“Easier said than done”  in today’s  busy-busy world! 😅

Its importance can never be overstated!

ALL  the leaders whom we ‘adore’  are  all  extraordinary ‘listeners’ (without exception)

It is (just) not practical to be labelled as an “outstanding leader” consistently, without being first recognised as an “effective listener” (by those nearer to him / her).

Giving our time (to others) is actually giving a piece of our life!   

How attentive / focused we are in any interaction determines its effectiveness.
 
We are all well aware of the ‘Theory and Importance’ of this topic.   Problems arise the moment ‘we’  begin to listen!

Imagine how badly we get irritated and how deep our ego gets hurt, if the person we interact with is seen fiddling with his / her phone, glancing a newspaper or busy walking / looking around!!

We all ‘know’ the answers on what shouldn’t be done and how we should behave. BUT .. STILL ..  ...

Maintaining  “eye-contact”  is the most critical aspect; next only to  paying  “100% attention”,  especially in any  non-casual  communication.

I can go to the extent of saying:  

Excellent  Communicator  = Empathetic  Listener.

When people come to take our advice / suggestions to their problems, we (often) observe that they find the solution on their own (without ourselves having to open our mouths) if they are convinced that we are “all ears”.   
That is the MAGIC of  paying 100% attention!  😄😃

Wish you all success in sustaining  your
“Amazing  Leader”  tag!

Your eternal well wisher 
ASM

PS:  

1.  Courtesy’ demands that we should consciously curb our urge to ‘speak’ without letting the other person complete his / her sentence.

2.  It is not uncommon for (most of) us to “utilise” the supposed-to-be ‘listening’ time for “preparing” our response (as soon as the other person says the first few words).  
Often, this results in confusion, embarrassment and ‘loss of face’!!



# Can an  Average  ‘All-rounder’ survive  today & tomorrow?

The world now is badly in need of  “Specialists”.  

Specialists are ‘always’ a rare commodity, in any field.  
We find an ‘order of magnitude’ difference, when it comes to their Compensation, Name & Fame. 

The so-called  ‘Generalists’, in any field, would find it (very) difficult to ‘survive’, these days.

Solid  “Depth”  instead of  shallow  “Breadth”  would make a  huge difference between  ‘merely  existing’  and  ‘truly  thriving’.

(Almost) ALL humans are gifted with ‘unique’ specialities (“Strengths”).  

“Spotting” these “Strengths” at an early age / stage  is  ‘half the battle won’!

Parents, Spouses, Teachers and ‘boss’es  —  all  have an important responsibility in identifying such “strengths” in ‘their’  people.

It is unfortunate that many people are  ‘ignoring’ (and are NOT  ‘focusing’ (much) on) their  ‘Strengths’  and  are ‘wasting’  a lot of time  trying to improve on (a long list of) their  ‘weak’ areas.  

I am  NOT against All-Rounders, in general.  

Naturally-talented  (God-gifted)  “All-Rounders” are far and few, in the world. (Those who have ‘consistently’ demonstrated  ‘exceptional’ talents in “two” or more ‘fields’ of “specialisation”).
(like  Gary Sobers, Kapil Dev, Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee; Charlie Chaplin (filmmaker), NTR (Sr), Ghantasala (music director), Amitabh (versatility), Bhanumati (singing / writing / dancing); SP Balu (mimicry / dubbing); Vajpayee (poetry), PVNR (Linguist), Imran Khan (politics); Bill Gates (CSR) and Gavaskar (commentator) .. to name only a few).

My  vote  is to keep “Refining” our  “Strengths”,  in tune with Market needs.

Your eternal well wisher 
ASM

PS:  

1. It would be hugely disheartening ending up  “Neither here .. Nor there”

2. Each person would have her / his own  list of  Top-20 Global  All-Rounders!  
(No need to fight!)  😃

3.  Drilling deep in one’s Specialty is an art in itself!

4.  There is no dearth of (variety of) Specialisations. 

5.  “Strengths based Leadership”  is fast gaining  in importance.  
This should not be left to L&D and HR alone;  CEOs should drive this, for their survival.


# “Peace of Mind”  and  ‘Forgiveness’ are inseparable!

“Forgiveness”  is  
The Noblest  ‘trait’  of  one’s  personality.   Undisputed!

Forgiveness  enhances  the  ‘Quality’  of  ‘our’  life.

Forgiveness   MAGICally  elevates  our  ‘character’. 

‘Stunningly’-Positive relationships / bonds  get  established, lifelong, when  Forgiveness  becomes our  second nature.

Forgiveness  is  ‘contagious’ too,  when the Leader of the Team / Family  (visibly) demonstrates it, time and again.

Forgiveness, when seen and felt as  NOT  ‘genuine’  has the power to ‘destroy’  one’s  character (instantly).
(Bad deeds / words  spread fast (thru  ‘whispers’)).

👉 ‘Moments’  we spend  in ‘thinking’  about  the  ‘wrongs’  
committed by someone should be treated as the time ‘stolen’ (from us)  from meeting  those who can “inspire / elevate”  us!

Why should we  then  ‘waste’ (any more) time in  nurturing  hatred  and  intolerance  towards anyone (on earth)?

After all,  lack of this  (trait) affects  our own  ‘Peace of Mind’ (day in & day out).  
For sure!

‘Kshama’  is  Divine!  🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

PS:   

Much easier to  get this inculcated, at toddler stage (itself)!   
Hope  young-parents and parents-to-be  take this seriously (and stand as a towering examples in the eyes of their wards).
Kids ‘follow’ their parents blindly, in such aspects too! 😇
